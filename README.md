🎶 Overview
This project is an AI-powered music analysis app that uses:

🎵 TensorFlow YAMNet for instrument and sound classification

📊 Librosa for musical feature extraction (tempo, pitch, etc.)

🧠 Groq's LLaMA3-70B LLM via LangChain for human-like music analysis

🌐 Gradio for a user-friendly web interface

🚀 Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for instant access

✨ Features
🎧 Instrument & Sound Classification (TensorFlow YAMNet)

📊 Audio Feature Extraction (tempo, pitch, etc. using Librosa)

🧠 LLM-Powered Natural Language Analysis (Groq LLaMA3 + LangChain)

🤖 Insights into Genres, Moods, and Musical Patterns

🖥️ Interactive Web UI with Gradio



🚀 How the System Works
This AI-powered music analysis app helps you explore the instrumentation, musical features, and even virality potential of any audio track. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

🎵 1. Upload an Audio File
Start by uploading any .wav, .mp3, or similar audio file.


🧠 2. Click "Analyze"
Hit the Analyze button to initiate the pipeline. The backend processes the audio using machine learning models and audio analysis libraries.

🎸 3. Instrument Detection
The system detects instruments present in the audio using the YAMNet model from TensorFlow Hub. You'll see a breakdown of the instruments involved.

📈 4. Estimate Virality Potential
Based on musical features (like tempo, rhythm, energy), the app estimates how "viral" or catchy a song might be.

🧠 5. LLM Music Analysis
We use a Groq-hosted LLaMA3-70B model via LangChain to generate human-like insights into the musical style, genre, and mood. This includes creative descriptions and even feedback on potential improvements.
